# Privacy

Dark factory is a Claude Code plugin and a set of templates that run on your own machine. Its author runs no service
for it: nothing is collected, there is no telemetry, and no data is sent to the author.

## What stays on your machine

- The guard's audit log (`.claude/state/audit.jsonl` in the project) and the fence settings (`.claude/fences.env`).
- The quota guard's cache and log (`~/.cache/claude-quota.json`, `claude-quota.log`, `claude-quota-agents.json`).
- The task queue (`bd`), the factory's project list (`~/.config/dark-factory/`) and the session settings of each project.

## What leaves it, and where it goes

- **Anthropic.** The quota guard learns the subscription's usage from one short request through your own `claude` CLI
  (no more often than every 10 minutes), unless the status line feeds it the numbers. No token is read.
- **GitHub.** `gh` and `git`, with your own login, for pushes, pull requests, CI status and releases.
- **Modules you install yourself:** the On-call agent reads and answers the client chat through the Telegram plugin; the
  production monitor reads a snapshot through a read-only database role you create and posts to that chat; the board is
  Linear through its own MCP server. Each one reaches only its own service, with credentials you give it.

- **Your phone, if you set up the status page.** With `FLEET_FEED_ADDR` in the server's `fleet.env`, `fleet.py serve`
  serves a status feed on that address (`/status.json`, and `/events` pushing every change): project names, whether
  their sessions and agents are working, the On-call and watchdog state, the quota numbers, and the link to each
  project's session. Only a private address is accepted (Tailscale on the reference setup); without
  `FLEET_FEED_TOKEN` there is no login, so anyone on that network can read it. With it every request must carry the
  token — the setting for a tunnel that makes the feed reachable from the internet (Tailscale Funnel on the reference
  setup); whoever holds the token can read the feed, so it lives only on your devices. With `FLEET_FEED_PAGE=on` the
  same address serves the status page; it only reads the feed and sends nothing back.

Nothing else is contacted. What each of those services does with the data is governed by its own policy.
