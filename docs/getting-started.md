# Getting started

How to go from nothing to one project running its full lifecycle with Claude Code. Read the [README](../README.md)
first for what the factory is; this page gives the steps in order.

**Install** (once, in Claude Code; nothing else is cloned):

```
/plugin marketplace add ruslantrachuk/dark-factory
/plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory
```

Then, in your project, **only want the fences?** `/dark-factory:init` (level 0) adds the guard hook, the quota
guard, the merge script and a pre-push test gate ([plugins/dark-factory/README.md](../plugins/dark-factory/README.md));
[a first session](#a-first-session-illustrative) below shows what that looks like. **The full path** is
`/dark-factory:add base` (level 1), then the modules with `/dark-factory:add <module>`, and for a server with several
projects `/dark-factory:provision-server` and `/dark-factory:factory-status`: the steps further down.

## Who this is for

- You build software with **Claude Code** on a Claude subscription, for yourself or for clients. You want the agent
  to do the middle of the pipeline (code, tests, release preparation) while you keep the edges: what to build,
  acceptance, and "ship it".
- Your code lives on **GitHub**. The default test stack and scripts are **Python**; other stacks work, but then you
  adapt the test pyramid and the gates yourself. The board is **Linear** (the `board` skill). The queue itself is
  `bd` in the repository and works without a board.
- Optional, per module: a **Telegram** group with the client (the On-call session) and **Postgres** in production
  (the monitor).
- The method itself is tool-agnostic; these are the tools the reference implementation is built on. The full list,
  and where each tool is wired in, is the [supported stack](functions.md#supported-stack). To use another tool for
  one function, rewrite what the **Seam** line of that skill or module names.

Not a fit if you need a hosted product, a non-Claude agent, or no human acceptance step at all.

## Words used everywhere

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| canon | this repository: the method (`docs/`) and the plugin with its templates (`plugins/dark-factory/templates/`) |
| your factory | your private repository (`/dark-factory:add factory`): the registry, the machines, the plugin pin, your own roles and notes ([your-factory.md](your-factory.md)) |
| Product owner, Spec writer, Reviewer, Operator | the four human roles. Product owner: what to build, and the client relationship. Spec writer: turns a request into a spec the agent can execute. Reviewer: accepts, merges and ships. Operator: the server, the sessions and production. One person can hold all four |
| stage | one of the six [lifecycle stages](process.md#the-lifecycle): Requirements, Development, Testing, Release, Monitoring, Support and feedback. The layers in [process.md](process.md) and the phases in [map.md](map.md) are finer cuts of the same pipeline |
| card | a unit of client-visible work on the board |
| `Merged` | the card state after a merge (merged, not yet shipped); the `board` skill uses this name |
| queue | the `bd` tasks in the project repository: the execution state |
| change | an OpenSpec change: proposal, design and tasks for one feature |
| change key | the name every work branch carries: `<type>/<ID>-<slug>` with a tracker, `<type>/<slug>` without; the spec folder is `openspec/changes/<slug>/` |
| GATE | the steps before any code: sizing the work (`size-task`), process skills, queue and branch, standards, user guide |
| development session | the long-lived Claude Code session of a project on the server |
| On-call session | the session that holds the client chat (the `feedback-desk` module) |
| dev stand | the environment that runs `main`: a merged change lands there, and a human looks at it and accepts it before a release; the `dev-stand` skill starts it |
| accepted | a merged PR with the label `accepted` and the comment `accepted by <who>, <link>`; `scripts/release.sh` refuses while a merge since the last tag lacks it |
| hook | a command Claude Code runs automatically at a set moment (before a tool call, at session start, when you send a prompt) |
| guard hook | the plugin's hook that reads every tool call before it runs and denies the dangerous ones, such as a force push, saying what to do instead |
| fence | a rule held by code (a hook, a script, a setting) rather than by an instruction the agent could ignore; `FENCE_LEVEL` sets how many are on |
| worktree | a second checkout of the same git repository in another folder, on its own branch, so two features can be worked on at once |
| subagent | a helper agent the main session starts for one task; it reports back and ends |
| test pyramid | many fast unit tests at the bottom, fewer integration and API tests above, a few slow browser tests on top |
| quota window | the subscription's usage limits, counted over the last 5 hours and the last 7 days; the quota guard watches both |
| review pass | the regular look back: what broke → a decision in `docs/` → a change in the plugin's `plugins/dark-factory/templates/` → rollout |

## What you need

**To start on a laptop** (steps 1–4 below):

| Tool | For | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code, logged in | everything | <https://code.claude.com> |
| the dark-factory plugin | the guard hook, the quota guard, the feature pipeline; `base` depends on it | `claude plugin marketplace add ruslantrachuk/dark-factory`, then `claude plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory` |
| `git`, `gh` (logged in, a current release: old distribution packages fail on `gh pr edit`) | branches, PRs, `merge-feature.sh` | <https://cli.github.com> |
| `bd` (beads) | the task queue | <https://github.com/steveyegge/beads> |
| `jq`, Python 3.11 or newer | queue scripts, quota guard, tests | your package manager |
| Superpowers plugin (recommended) | the skills of GATE step 0 | `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` |

The OpenSpec CLI is not required: OpenSpec is used as a folder convention.

**Only for the server and the modules** (steps 5–7):

| Tool | For | Install |
|---|---|---|
| A small Linux server with `tmux` and a systemd user instance (`systemctl --user`) | long-lived sessions (`/dark-factory:provision-server`) | any VPS |
| Bun | the On-call and monitor channels (`add on-call`, `add monitor`) | <https://bun.sh> |
| `uv` | the monitor's own Python environment (`add monitor`) | <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/> |

Server provisioning needs Linux with a systemd user instance. macOS is for attended sessions on your own machine,
not for the server.

## Steps

1. **Install the plugin** (the two `/plugin` commands above). After `init` or `add base` (step 2), the project's
   `.claude/settings.json` pins the plugin to a release (`"ref": "v11"`); raising the pin is how a project takes a new
   release. With more than one project, create a private repository of your own and run
   `/dark-factory:add factory` in it: [your own factory](your-factory.md).
2. **Set up a project.** Open Claude Code in the project and run `/dark-factory:add base`. It shows a dry run of
   `deploy-base.sh` (which copies the plugin's own `plugins/dark-factory/templates/base`), asks the configuration questions one at a time,
   including whether the project has production (then releases by tag are installed with it), fills in the
   placeholders, names the modules worth adding and writes the registry row if you keep one. One question is the
   fence level: `solo`, `standard` (default) or `team` — how strictly the guard hook holds pushes, merges and edits to
   the fence files. Nothing leaves your machine without your "yes". Then turn on GitHub branch protection for main
   (block force pushes, require a pull request; `team` also requires an approval): it is the backstop the hooks
   cannot be.
3. **First session in the project.** Open Claude Code in the project. The SessionStart hooks print the queue, the
   branch's PR and the latest merges, and the quota; `CLAUDE.md` holds the operating contract. Write the first OpenSpec change for a
   small feature, approve it, run `openspec-to-beads`, and let the session build the first phase.
4. **Merge, accept, ship.** Review the branch; once CI is green the session runs `scripts/merge-feature.sh <branch>`, which writes the PR description into
   the merge commit. A solo project with no CI workflows yet merges on the local gate
   (the pre-push test command), and the merge commit says `CI: none (local gate)`; `team` refuses this. If CI exists
   but cannot run (for example, Actions is blocked by billing), say so: `--skip-ci "<reason>"` runs the local gate
   instead and marks the merge prominently. The merge puts the change on the dev stand (the `dev-stand` skill): look there. A project with production releases by tag
   (`vYYYY.MM.DD.N`, part of base); a release takes all of main, so `scripts/release.sh` asks that every merge since the
   last tag be accepted (the label `accepted`); you say "release" in the session and confirm the permission dialog, or
   the On-call asks the requester "ship?" first ([acceptance](layers/acceptance.md)).
5. **Put it on the server.** On the server, install the plugin, clone the project and log Claude Code in. List the
   project in `~/.config/dark-factory/projects`, one checkout path per line (`#` starts a comment):

   ```
   # projects this server runs
   ~/code/my-app
   ~/code/client-portal
   ```

   Then run `/dark-factory:provision-server` in Claude Code on the server. The development session appears in
   claude.ai and the mobile app under its name, and comes back after a reboot.
6. **Optional modules**, each by one command that first lists the steps only you can do: `/dark-factory:add on-call`
   (client chat → On-call → development session), `monitor` (production failures reported to the group),
   `observability`, `feature-pipeline`, `release`, `code-audit`. A project on base carries the module catalogue in
   `.harness/modules.md`.
7. **Watch the fleet.** `/dark-factory:factory-status` shows every project on the server. The review pass
   updates projects to the plugin's templates (`copier update` in each project; `.harness/README.md`).
   **On a Mac** (optional, macOS only): the FactoryBar menu bar app shows the same at a glance — working now, the
   On-call, the watchdog and the quota, updated within seconds — and opens a project's session on a click. Set
   `FLEET_FEED_ADDR=<private address>:<port>` in the server's `~/.config/dark-factory/fleet.env`, run
   `fleet.py provision`, then build the app: [macos/FactoryBar](../macos/FactoryBar/README.md).

## A first session (illustrative)
