name: investigate
description: Investigate an incident in production or in a preview environment — by correlation_id, a user complaint (who + when), the request text, an alert name or "something broke". Collects logs, the DB (read-only), LLM traces and metrics, builds a timeline, names the root cause with evidence. Use for "figure out why…", "the bot didn't answer", "an alert fired", "a user is complaining", "investigate", and when the On-call agent of a group forwarded a complaint.

# Skill `investigate` — incident investigation

> A skeleton from the dark-factory canon (the "Incident investigation" practice, `docs/practices/incidents.md`).
> The order and rules are generic (distilled from many analysed incidents across projects);
> the "Project sources" section is filled in by the project and verified by a live run.

> **Seam:** hosting logs and metrics, the production DB and the LLM tracer = the project's own tools. To use another tool, rewrite the "Project sources" section.

**An investigation is diagnosis, not permission to make changes** (CLAUDE.md, rule 6). The result is a report
and a proposal; the fix goes the usual feature path (bd task → branch → TDD).

## Rules (generic, do not change)

1. **Production is read-only.** Read the database through a separate read-only role or a SELECT-only script; hosting tools and MCP servers that can write are off-limits during an investigation. Changes to production (migration, restart, rollback) are made by the owner.
2. **Do not print secrets; keep personal data out of the report:** use `user_id`/`correlation_id`, not names or users' messages verbatim, whenever you can.
3. **Save evidence to the tracker before anything is deleted** (a bd task with an excerpt), if something has to be cleaned up.
4. **A missing source does not block you.** Carry on and list the gap under "What was missing".
5. **Check facts about sources; do not assume them.** Measure log retention, delivery delay and trace coverage in preflight (a skill once claimed 30 days of retention when it was really 3, and only a blind-spot audit found out).
6. **Several matches: list them and ask; do not pick one yourself.** A match by time without a key is marked "approximate".
7. **Prove "not our code"** by showing the code and environment along the request path did not change (`git log` of the path, a config diff), e.g. when an external API tightened its format.
8. **Check the path the user takes** (through the proxy or load balancer, with the same headers), not a shortcut around it (a live check that bypasses nginx proves nothing).

## Project sources (fill in; verify with preflight)

| Source | How to read | Search key | Retention (measured) | If no access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| logs | `<cloud CLI / files / docker logs>` | `correlation_id`, `event`, `user_id` | `<…>` | `<fallback: file export>` |
| DB (read-only) | `<scripts/ops/investigate_db.py or psql with a ro role>` | `<tables with correlation_id>` | — | `<…>` |
| LLM traces | `<tracer / none>` | `correlation_id` in metadata | `<…>` | — |
| metrics and alerts | `<dashboard>`; alert catalogue — `<docs/deploy/monitoring-alerts.md>` | alert name → metric | `<…>` | — |
| release version | startup log (`version`) | incident time | — | — |
| `<project-specific: queue, diagnostics page, hosting>` | | | | |

## Order

### 0. Preflight
One line per source: is it reachable, is it authorized, what is the real retention. Red — a hint on how to fix it, and continue without it.

### 1. Input → key
| Given | Action |
|---|---|
| `correlation_id` | straight to collection |
| user + approximate time | logs/DB by `user_id` in the window → `correlation_id` |
| request text | search the project's input table or logs → `correlation_id` |
| alert name | alert catalogue → metric → window → ERROR events in the window → `correlation_id` |
| "something broke" | ERRORs and anomalous metrics for the window → list of candidates → ask |

Widen the time windows in steps (with some CLIs a large window silently returns nothing).

### 2. Collection
All sources by the same key. Raw excerpts — in working notes, not in the report in full.

### 3. Timeline
Steps from input to answer (input → routing → LLM/external API calls → write → answer/delivery), each marked: normal / anomaly / error. Release version at the time of the incident.

### 4. Root cause
Class: `<project classes: prompt / data / retrieval / …>` + the mandatory `code`, `infra`, `external`, `config`. Rule hypotheses out with facts, not with plausibility. No root cause yet? Use code analysis (skill `code-audit`, mode "figure it out") along the timeline.

### 5. Report
```
## Incident: <correlation_id or short name>, <date>
What happened: <1–2 sentences, what the user saw>
Root cause: <class> — <explanation>
Evidence:
- <source>: <fact>
Release version: <…>
Recommendation: <what to fix: the root, not the symptom; where to degrade instead of failing>
What a human must do: <token rotation, manual migration, … — if any>
What was missing: <sources that were unavailable and what that risks for the next analysis>
```

### 6. Handing over to work (after the owner's "yes")
1. A bd task (bug) with the report; significant ones — a card on the board (skill `board`).
2. Fix along the feature path: reproduce with a failing test that "fails exactly like prod" (`systematic-debugging` → TDD), fix the root; the regression test — one level lower (push-tests-down); in the commit — why the existing tests did not catch it.
3. Record the analysis in the devlog: date, symptom, how it was found, `correlation_id`, root cause, fix, remaining human actions.
4. A rule, if the incident suggested one, — into the project (CLAUDE.md/CODING_STANDARDS "rule + episode"); one that recurs in two projects — a canon candidate at the next collection.
5. If this skill was wrong (a source, retention, a command), fix this file in the same PR.
6. The complaint came from a feedback group — answer in the group through the On-call agent (skill `feedback-desk`): what was found and when the fix will land, without internal details.
