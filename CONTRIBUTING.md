## Ground rules

- **English only** — prose, comments, identifiers, string literals, LLM prompts, test names. The only exception is
  deliberate non-ASCII test data that exercises UTF-8 handling (mark it with a short comment).
- **Canon, not instance.** This repository holds the canon: the methodology (`docs/`) and the templates
  (`plugins/dark-factory/templates/`). Your own factory instance — the registry (`registry.md`, created from
  [the factory template](plugins/dark-factory/templates/factory/registry.md)), filled-in skill configurations, project lists, client names, hosts —
  lives in your own private factory repository and never comes back here. Improvements found in an instance or a
  project are carried over into `plugins/dark-factory/templates/` by hand, in generic form, without names of people, clients or projects.
- `plugins/dark-factory/templates/base/scripts/merge-feature.sh` is the one merge script: `/dark-factory:init` and
  `/dark-factory:add base` both copy it from the plugin, so there is nothing to keep in step.
- Everything a user needs ships inside `plugins/dark-factory/` (commands, scripts, templates, workflows): a change must
  not make an installed plugin depend on a file outside that directory. The repository root holds only what is about
  the repository itself (docs, checks, CI).
- Keep changes to the canon behaviour-preserving unless the change is the point; a new module or a change of its
  "when it is time" signal is also a row in [plugins/dark-factory/templates/base/.harness/modules.md](plugins/dark-factory/templates/base/.harness/modules.md)
  in the same commit.

## Running the tests

Python 3.11+ with `pytest` (and the packages from the module's `requirements.txt` where present), Node 20+, bash.

```bash
# dark-factory plugin: guard, quota guard, solo kit scaffolding, level detection, module install (stdlib only)
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_guard.py
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_quota.py
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_init_kit.py
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_level.py
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_add_module.py

# Plugin and marketplace manifests (Claude Code CLI)

# Repository wiring: the plugin hooks and skills point at real files, base ships none of what the plugin
# carries, deploy-base.sh writes the starting fence level, nothing at the repository root is needed by the plugin
python3 scripts/test_repo.py

# Factory fleet tooling (in the plugin)
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_fleet.py
python3 plugins/dark-factory/scripts/test_feedback_desk.py

# base app: unit + integration tests (e2e needs a running dev stand)

# release-tag module: release.sh against a temporary bare repo

# prod-monitor module

```

All of the above must stay green before a pull request. CI ([.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))
runs the same list on every push and pull request; a new suite is added to both in the same commit.

## Versioning

- Releases are sequential: `v1`, `v2`, … A release is the tag `v<N>` on main, and the plugin's version in
  [plugins/dark-factory/.claude-plugin/plugin.json](plugins/dark-factory/.claude-plugin/plugin.json) is `<N>.0.0`. It is
  bumped in the same commit that prepares the release; Claude Code updates installed copies only when that string
  changes. The marketplace entry carries no `version` of its own. (A project's own releases from the `release-tag`
  module are `vYYYY.MM.DD.N` and unrelated.)
- The same commit pins the marketplace in the templates (`"ref": "v<N>"` in
  [base](plugins/dark-factory/templates/base/.claude/settings.json) and
  [solo](plugins/dark-factory/templates/solo/.claude/settings.json) and
  [factory](plugins/dark-factory/templates/factory/.claude/settings.json) `.claude/settings.json`);
  `scripts/test_repo.py` checks that the version and the pins agree. There is no CHANGELOG file: what changed is the
  merged pull requests, and what to do about it is their `## Upgrade` sections. `.harness/base-sha` in a project holds `v<N>` when the files were copied by an installed plugin; run from a git
  checkout of the canon it records the commit SHA instead. `/dark-factory:factory-status` compares it with the
  installed plugin.
- Projects pin the plugin by the marketplace's `ref` in `.claude/settings.json`, or by adding the marketplace at the
  tag — `/plugin marketplace add ruslantrachuk/dark-factory#v<N>` — since the plugin's relative source in the
  marketplace cannot carry a ref of its own. Moving a project to a newer release is a deliberate change of that pin.
- **A pull request's `## Upgrade` section** ([template](.github/pull_request_template.md)) says what a live project
  or the server must do after updating to the release that carries it: a `fleet.py provision` run, a line in a config
  file, a one-time step. It is omitted when there is nothing to do. A change that breaks a deployed project's files or
  settings always has one; fences get stricter only in a release, never silently.
- **Releasing** (the owner; the guard denies an agent the tag push): after the release commit is merged,
  `git tag v<N> origin/main && git push origin v<N>`, then
  `python3 scripts/release_notes.py v<N-1> v<N> > /tmp/notes.md`, check it by hand, and
  `gh release create v<N> --generate-notes --notes-file /tmp/notes.md`. GitHub lists the merged pull requests; the
  notes add **How to upgrade**, which `/dark-factory:upgrade` reads in each project. Last,
  `git push origin v<N>^{commit}:refs/heads/release` moves the `release` branch to the tag (a fast-forward; the first
  release creates the branch).
- **The `release` branch** holds the latest release and moves only in that last step. The Claude plugin directory
  follows it, so a merge to `main` does not reach the directory until it is released. Nothing is committed to
  `release` directly.
