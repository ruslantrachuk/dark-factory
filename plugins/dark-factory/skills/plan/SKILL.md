# Skill `plan` — a phase into slices

A plan is a list of slices. Each slice, once committed, works from the entry point (webhook, route, command,
dispatcher) to the result for at least its own scenario and is covered by a test at the entry level. Never slice by
layers (data, then API, then UI) and never "all tests first, then code": between such slices the feature is not wired
up and a dead path passes every test.

## Steps

1. **Read** `CLAUDE.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md` and the source: the OpenSpec change (`proposal.md` with its WHEN/THEN
   scenarios, `design.md` when present, the phase in `tasks.md`), the spec, or the bd task.
2. **Read the actual code** the phase touches: repositories, services, dispatchers, settings, scheduled jobs,
   migrations. Plan edits to real files, not imagined ones; cross-check the design's "as-is" (file:line) if it has one.
3. **Cut the slices.** Fewer, file-coherent ones: a slice is the test file(s) and code file(s) that are always edited
   together. Split only along a real boundary — different files, or a dependency (the migration and repository are
   needed by the service, the service by the dispatchers). A file edited by two slices belongs to one of them; the
   other depends on it. The first slice is the narrowest scenario in full (with its migration, if one is needed).
4. **One edit node.** When the change sits on a path several entry points reach (a shared dispatcher, a ladder of
   branches), name the shared node, not each branch, and pin the behaviour at every entry point with its own test case.
5. **Write each slice:**
   - `key` (`3.1`), `title` in the project language (≤70 characters);
   - `description` — what exactly to do, tied to the requirement it closes;
   - `files[]` — paths from the repository root, new files and test files included;
   - `testPlan` — each test with its layer from `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §Test pyramid (the project's layers and
     directories) and what it checks; a rule goes to the lowest layer that can check it (a pure function — unit),
     api only for the HTTP contract (the `build-tdd` step 4 rule);
   - `acceptance` — criteria a reviewer can check; `blockedBy[]` — keys it depends on.
6. **Check before you hand it on** — the commonest faults of a plan:
   - every existing path in `files[]` exists (`ls`); test files are found where they live (`find <tests> -name …`) —
     suites live in several folders, and a wrong guess creates a duplicate instead of extending one;
   - every method, field and function named in a description or acceptance exists (`grep -rn "def <name>"`), or a
     slice adds it;
   - every message catalog key a slice needs is added by a slice that edits the catalog;
   - a requirement map: each requirement (a MUST of the spec, a `tasks.md` item, an acceptance criterion of the bug)
     names the slices that close it; none is left without one.
7. **Forks** — a safe default (KISS/YAGNI; a new flag defaults to off, the old path stays behind it), written down as
   an assumption. In a person's session, a fork that needs a product decision goes to the owner instead.
8. **Record the plan:**
   - in a session: the slices become children of the phase's bd task —
     `bd create --parent=<phase id> --type=task --title="…" --description="…\n\nFILES: <files>\nTESTS: <testPlan>" --acceptance="…" --design="key: <key>"`,
     then `bd dep add <slice> <dependency>` for each `blockedBy`. The feature pipeline (`feature-core`) can build the
     same graph unattended;
   - in a workflow: return the plan in the format the task asks; the run creates the subtasks itself.

No code and no commits while planning. Next: **`build-tdd`**, one slice at a time in dependency order.
