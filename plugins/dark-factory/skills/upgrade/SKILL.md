# /dark-factory:upgrade — move the project to a newer release

A release is the tag `v<N>` of https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory with a GitHub Release whose notes end
with **How to upgrade**: the steps a live project or the server must do beyond the file update. Copier updates only
the base template's files; modules (On-call, monitor, release), server units and one-time transitions are in those
notes. This skill does both, on a work branch, and merges like any other change.

## Rules

1. **A work branch and a reviewed merge.** `chore/upgrade-v<N>` from a fresh main, a clean working tree, merge only
   through `scripts/merge-feature.sh`. The pin in `.claude/settings.json` and other fence files change here: their
   writes go through the permission dialog — the owner's yes is the decision to upgrade.
2. **Server steps are named, never run.** `fleet.py provision`, a line in `~/.config/dark-factory/fleet.env`, the
   user-level plugin update — they touch the whole server and are the owner's: list them in the PR's `## Upgrade`
   section and in the final answer.
3. **No conflict marker in a commit.** Resolve every one as `.harness/README.md`, "Updating" says.

## Steps

1. **Versions.** The project's release: `_commit` in `.copier-answers.yml`, else `.harness/base-sha` (`v<N>`; a
   commit SHA means it was copied from a canon checkout — `scripts/harness-diff.sh` first, then add
   `.copier-answers.yml` as "Updating" says). The target: the argument, else the installed plugin's version
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `<N>.0.0` → `v<N>`), else the latest release
   (`gh release list -R ruslantrachuk/dark-factory --limit 1`). Equal → say "on v<N>, nothing to do" and stop.
2. **Notes.** For every release after the project's up to the target:
   `gh release view v<k> -R ruslantrachuk/dark-factory`. Show the owner the list of releases and their "How to
   upgrade" steps, split into *project* (files, settings, docs in this repository) and *server* (provision,
   fleet.env, plugin update). Ask for a yes before changing anything.
3. **Branch and update.** `git switch -c chore/upgrade-v<N> origin/<main>`, then
   `uvx copier@9.19.1 update --defaults --conflict inline --vcs-ref v<N>` (without `uvx`:
   `pipx run copier==9.19.1 …`). Find the markers with `git grep -nE '^(<<<<<<<|>>>>>>>) (before|after) updating'` and resolve each: keep the project's
   configuration, take the canon's procedure text, carry the canon's meaning into text the project rewrote. A conflict
   on `.harness/base-sha` or the pin `"ref"` resolves to `v<N>`.
4. **Project steps.** Apply each project step of the notes, in release order. A step that needs the owner (a secret,
   a GitHub setting) goes into the PR as an open question, not around them.
5. **Check.** Run the project's gates (the fast test suite and linters its CLAUDE.md names). On a red gate, fix what
   the update broke or stop and report; never skip a test.
6. **PR.** Commit, push, open the PR with `## Done` (releases crossed, files updated, markers resolved, project steps
   applied), `## Decisions`, `## Open questions`, and `## Upgrade` listing the server steps for the owner. Merge with
   `scripts/merge-feature.sh` once CI is green. After the merge, start new sessions: a running one keeps the old
   rules (`/dark-factory:factory-status` flags worktrees behind main).
7. **Verify the install, not the update output.** After the owner's server steps, the plugin must be *installed* for
   this checkout, not only enabled in `.claude/settings.json`: `/dark-factory:factory-status` shows `● plugin`, and
   the SessionStart line says "enforced", not "dark-factory NOT LOADED". `plugin update` answers "already at latest"
   for a project that has no install at all — its output proves nothing. A missing install is fixed by
   `claude plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory --scope project` in the project's main checkout and a restart of
   its sessions; list that step in `## Upgrade` whenever the server steps re-add the marketplace or move the pin.
