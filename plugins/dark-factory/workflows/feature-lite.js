(2) Wrap — one agent: bd tracing + project document sync + the PR description. (3) PR — optional (push + gh pr create; merged afterwards via scripts/merge-feature.sh <branch>). One repository: code (<appSubdir>/src, <appSubdir>/tests; appSubdir defaults to app) and harness (openspec/) in one tree; the bd store lives in the main checkout, outside git.',

//   models? ({implement?} — model id for the build, wrap-up and PR agents; left out, they inherit the session's model),

// by hand (check with `scripts/merge-feature.sh <branch> --print-bd-id`).
