"""The factory over its projects: provision the server, show the status of every project.

Projects of this server: one checkout path per line in $FLEET_PROJECTS (default
~/.config/dark-factory/projects; `#` comments). Without that file only a hand-filled registry works, one whose
"Repository" column holds absolute checkout paths (`/…` or `~/…` in backticks): a factory registry holds none.
Two different checkouts with the same directory name are refused (the directory name is the project's slug).
A project gets, on the server where this runs (user systemd units, survive a reboot):
  - its development session: `claude --name <SESSION_NAME> --remote-control <SESSION_NAME> -w dev-session` from the
    project's main checkout, inside its own tmux server — one interactive session with Remote Control in its own
    worktree (.claude/worktrees/dev-session, reused after a restart), so its name (what other sessions address) is its
    own from the start and survives /clear; a person drives it from claude.ai, so the guard
    asks for fence changes there in the permission dialog;
  - the owner's new sessions: `claude remote-control --spawn worktree --no-create-session-in-dir` (tmux server
    df-<slug>.rc) — each session opened from claude.ai gets its own git worktree;
  - its On-call session, if the project has the feedback-desk module (scripts/feedback-desk.sh), plus a timer
    that re-runs the idempotent `feedback-desk.sh up` every 5 minutes, so a crashed On-call comes back;
  - its dev stand's updater, if the project has scripts/stand-update.sh: a timer runs `fleet.py stand <checkout>`
    every minute — on a new commit of origin's default branch it moves the main checkout there (never one with
    changes or on another branch) and runs the script (rebuild, migrate, restart, smoke). The sessions cannot do it:
    each works in its own worktree. A session spawned with --spawn same-dir would work in the stand's checkout: the
    updater then stops at "uncommitted changes";
With FLEET_ANALYTICS_REPO=<checkout> in fleet.env, df-fleet-analytics.timer (Mondays 05:20 UTC) runs
scripts/analytics.py: it counts the week's work of every project here and opens a draft PR with the numbers in that
checkout's repository, for the owner to merge; without the setting the pair is removed.
df-fleet-janitor.timer (daily, 06:30 UTC) runs `fleet.py janitor` over every project: the clean worktrees whose branch
is merged go, then the local branches merged into origin's default branch that no worktree has checked out, then, for a
project with a bd store, the review of its execution queue (scripts/triage.py): the report opens a review session
(Remote Control, seen in claude.ai), and the owner's answer there closes or defers what it proposed.
The prod-monitor watchdog lives in cron (prod-monitor.sh install) and needs nothing here.
For the owner's menu bar app (macos/FactoryBar): `fleet.py feed` writes ~/.local/state/dark-factory/status.json
(fleet_feed.py: per project working now, agents, waiting for quota, On-call and watchdog, last worked; quota from the
cache only, never a probe). With FLEET_FEED_ADDR=<private address>:<port> in fleet.env, df-fleet-feed.timer runs it
every 15 minutes and df-fleet-serve serves it there (`fleet.py serve`), refreshing working now, agents and quota
within seconds and pushing every change on /events; without the setting they are removed. The feed also lists
every df- timer of the server and of each project (installed, enabled, next and last run, how it ended) and the
account's recurring cloud routines, which df-fleet-routines.timer (daily, 07:00 UTC) reads with a short headless
Claude run (`fleet.py routines`).
For the whole server: a unit that fails tells the owner (OnFailure=df-notify@%n → `fleet.py notify`), and
df-fleet-watch.timer runs `fleet.py status --notify` every 15 minutes — one message when a project's session,
On-call or monitor changes state (a login or folder-trust prompt included), silence while nothing changes.
Notifications go, by ~/.config/dark-factory/fleet.env:
  FLEET_NOTIFY=session   into the factory session — a Claude session with Remote Control on this server, seen in
                         claude.ai ("Factory · <host>", FLEET_SESSION_NAME): a notice goes to it as a message from
                         another session while it runs, or opens it with the notice as its first message;
  FLEET_NOTIFY_CMD=…     a command that reads the message on stdin (e.g. a curl to a chat bot);
  neither                the journal.

Platform: Linux with a systemd user instance (`systemctl --user`) only. On macOS (or any machine without one)
nothing is provisioned: the sessions there are attended — started by hand and gone after a restart.

  fleet.py projects                 list projects found in the registry
  fleet.py provision [--dry-run]    write and enable the units, enable lingering
  fleet.py unprovision [--dry-run]  stop and remove the units (--project X also finds units whose line is gone)
  fleet.py status [--notify]        read-only status of every project (+ stale worktrees, and session worktrees
                                    on other rules than main: no plugin, or an older canon);
                                    --notify: also tell the owner what changed since the last run
  fleet.py gc [--apply]             remove clean worktrees whose branch is merged into origin's default
                                    branch, then the merged local branches no worktree has checked out (dry run
                                    without --apply; a dirty or busy worktree, an unmerged branch is never touched)
  fleet.py feed                     write status.json for the menu bar app (read-only otherwise)
  fleet.py serve                    serve status.json and /events (pushed in seconds) on FLEET_FEED_ADDR
                                    (fleet.env; a private address only)
  fleet.py routines                 what the daily timer runs: save the account's recurring cloud routines for
                                    the feed (a headless Claude run reads the trigger API)
  fleet.py janitor                  what the daily timer runs: `gc --apply`; what needs a judgement (a merged
                                    worktree with changes, an unmerged worktree or branch quiet for 14 days) handed
                                    once to the project's development session; the queue review of every project
                                    with a bd store
  fleet.py notify UNIT              one line to the owner: UNIT failed (used by df-notify@.service)
  fleet.py stand CHECKOUT [--retry] what df-<slug>-stand runs: update the dev stand to origin's default branch;
                                    --retry tries a commit whose update failed again
  fleet.py upgrade v<N> [--dry-run] move this server to a release: the owner's pin and the marketplace, every
                                    project's main checkout and plugin, the units from the new plugin, the live
                                    feed; restarting the sessions asks first
(run as `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/fleet.py" …`; the skills do)

Per-project settings (optional), <project>/.claude/factory/session.env:
  SESSION_NAME="Shop server"     the development session's name in ListAgents / claude.ai (default: "<dir name> server")
  RC_NAME="Shop new"             the owner's remote-control in claude.ai (default: "<SESSION_NAME> · new sessions")
  SESSION_ARGS="--permission-mode auto"   extra arguments for the owner's `claude remote-control` (the permission
      mode also for the development session), an allowlist:
      --permission-mode default|acceptEdits|plan|auto,   --spawn same-dir|worktree|session (default worktree)
      and --capacity 1..8 (concurrent sessions; default 3 — the CLI's own default is 32, each one spending quota).
      Anything else (bypassPermissions, --dangerously-*, other flags) refuses to provision that project:
      the file is project-local and its value lands in a systemd ExecStart.
  JANITOR_HANDOFF=off            the janitor does not hand this project's leftovers to its development session

Options: --projects FILE, --registry PATH (default: $FACTORY_REGISTRY or ./registry.md), --project NAME,
--stale-days N (a worktree with no commit for N days is reported as stale; default 14).
Template drift: a project's .harness/base-sha is a release tag (v<N>, compared with this plugin's major version) or a
commit SHA (counted in the git checkout $FACTORY_CANON, default: the one this plugin is in, if any); the quota line
comes from this plugin's scripts/quota.py.
Attach to a development session: tmux -L df-<slug> attach.
