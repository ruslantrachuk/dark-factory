"""Fence guard (PreToolUse hook): the agent cannot do what only a human may decide.

Instructions in CLAUDE.md ("do not push without asking", "merge only after a human's yes")
are advice; this hook is the fence. It reads the hook JSON on stdin and answers `deny` with
what to do instead, or — for a change to the fences themselves — `ask`. stdlib only, Python 3.11+.

Bash — denied at every level (`solo` and up):
  * `git push` with -f/--force/--force-with-lease/--force-if-includes/--mirror or a `+refspec`;
    a long option counts by any prefix git would expand (`--forc`, `--no-verif`, `--tag`);
  * a push to a protected branch: `main`, `master`, origin's HEAD branch, MAIN_BRANCH of
    scripts/merge-feature.sh, and the production branch (`release`, or RELEASE_BRANCH of
    scripts/release.sh) — `git push origin main`, `HEAD:heads/main`, `git push` while on it, `--all`,
    a `*` pattern, deleting it; a destination computed at run time (`feat:$B`, `HEAD:$(…)`) is denied
    too, except `$(git branch --show-current)` / `$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`;
  * `--no-verify` on `git commit`/`git push`, `-n` on `git commit`, hooks re-pointed away from
    `.githooks` (git config, `git -c`, `GIT_CONFIG_*` variables, an edit of .git/config or .git/hooks/);
  * git configuration that runs or reroutes things: `git -c` / `git config` of alias.*, core.hooksPath,
    core.fsmonitor, core.pager, core.sshCommand, diff.external, *.textconv, filter.*, include*, pager.*,
    push.*, remote.*.push|mirror|receivepack; `GIT_CONFIG_*`/`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`/`GIT_EXEC_PATH` set for
    a command. An existing git alias is expanded and checked like the command it stands for;
  * pushing release tags (`v*`, also `--tags`/`--follow-tags`), `gh release create|edit|delete` —
    that is scripts/release.sh;
  * the GitHub API used to do the same: `gh api` (or curl/wget/httpie to api.github.com, or any request
    carrying the gh token) that writes refs, contents, merges or releases, changes branch protection or
    rulesets; a GraphQL query read from a file; `gh alias set|import`;
  * `git branch -d/-D` of the main branch, `git reset --hard` while on the main branch; rewriting
    origin's remote-tracking refs (they hold the main branch's fence level, see below);
  * deleting, moving or overwriting .git/config or .git/hooks/ from the shell (an ancestor counts:
    `rm -rf .`), an Edit/Write of .git/hooks/* or of .git/config that touches hooks, aliases, pagers…;
  * any write into the installed plugin: `~/.claude/plugins/**`, `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (unless it is
    inside the project: a plugin under development) and the plugin's state `~/.cache/dark-factory`
    (the level grants, `prompt-hook`) — the plugin changes through its canon repository and an update;
  * booking a `/dark-factory:level <level>` prompt the human did not type: in a scheduling or
    messaging tool's input (send_later, triggers, CronCreate, ScheduleWakeup, send_message…) or a
    `claude` run from Bash.
Fence changes — asked at every level (see "Ask or deny" below):
  * deleting, moving or overwriting from the shell .claude/fences.env, .claude/settings*.json,
    ~/.claude/settings*.json, .githooks/: a redirection, rm/mv/cp/tee/sed -i/awk -i inplace…, a glob or
    an ancestor directory that covers them (`rm -rf .cl*`), `find … -delete|-exec`, `git rm/mv`,
    `git checkout <rev> -- …`, `git restore --source …`, `git clean` / `git stash -u|--all` while one of
    them is untracked (or ignored, with -x/--all);
  * any other command that names them (`fences.env`, `disableAllHooks`, `.claude/settings`) unless it
    only reads (cat, grep, git diff…): an interpreter one-liner (`python3 -c "open('.claude/fences.env','w')"`)
    is not a read;
  * lowering FENCE_LEVEL (or QUOTA_FAIL_CLOSED 1 → 0) with Edit/Write/MultiEdit: the old and the new
    text are compared; an edit whose new value cannot be told counts as a change. The usual way is
    `/dark-factory:level <level>`, which the human types (scripts/level.py);
  * an edit of any Claude Code settings file that adds disableAllHooks/allowManagedHooksOnly, a
    GUARD/QUOTA_GUARD variable, sets `dark-factory@…` to false or drops it from enabledPlugins;
    `claude plugin disable|uninstall` of it from Bash; `GUARD`/`QUOTA_GUARD` set or exported for a command
    (a child `claude` would inherit it and run unfenced).
Acceptance and release decisions (module release-tag; every level), see "Release decisions" below:
  * a run of `scripts/release.sh` that tags (no `--publish`), `scripts/feedback-desk.sh release|accept`;
  * marking a feature accepted by hand: `gh pr|issue edit --add-label accepted`, `gh label create|edit|delete|clone`,
    `gh pr|issue comment` with "accepted by" (or a body the guard cannot read), and the `gh api` equivalents.
Added at `standard` (the default) and `team`:
  * `gh pr merge` (and the merge API) — merging goes through scripts/merge-feature.sh, which
    waits for green CI (and, at `team`, the PR's approval); `gh pr review --approve` (and the review API) — approvals are
    given by people — denied;
  * any edit of the fence files (.claude/settings*.json, .claude/fences.env, .githooks/,
    scripts/merge-feature.sh) with Edit/Write or a Bash write — asked.

Ask or deny: a fence change is the human's to allow. When a human can be present the guard answers
`ask`, and Claude Code shows the call in its permission dialog with the guard's reason; it runs only on
a yes. In a launched agent nobody can answer, so the guard denies it and says to leave it to the human
(write the patch and a note, keep going): a subagent (the hook input carries `agent_id`), a session our
launchers start (`DF_UNATTENDED=1`: the On-call of feedback-desk.sh), `claude -p` or another SDK run
(`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=sdk-…`) other than a remote-control session (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENVIRONMENT_KIND=bridge`:
its dialogs reach the owner in the Claude app and claude.ai). These signals come from the hook's own input and environment; a miss
costs liveness, not safety (`ask` inside `claude -p` is a deny in every permission mode). When a call has
both a fence change and something denied, the deny wins: a yes never lets a denied part through.

Part of the dark-factory plugin (hooks/hooks.json); the project is $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (else the
git top level of the hook's cwd). A project opts in with `.claude/fences.env` (in the working tree
or on origin's main branch): without it the guard stays silent, so a plugin installed for the user
does not fence unrelated projects. The fence level is the stricter of the working tree's
`.claude/fences.env` and the same file on origin's main branch (FENCE_LEVEL=solo|standard|team,
default standard): lowering it takes a change merged into the main branch.

How a command is read: quoted strings and heredoc bodies are data, not commands (a commit
message may say "--force" or "gh pr merge"); the line is split on && || ; | & newlines and
parentheses; `$(…)`/backticks — also inside double quotes and unquoted heredocs — `bash -c '…'`,
`eval` and a heredoc fed to a shell are checked as commands of their own; `env`/`VAR=` prefixes,
wrappers (`command`, `nohup`, `xargs`, `timeout`…), `cd`, `env -C` and `git -C dir` are followed.
A static reading has limits (a value hidden in a variable or a script file is not seen); the main
branch's fence level, permissions.deny in settings.json and GitHub branch protection are the
further layers.

Release decisions: a release takes all of main to production and acceptance is its precondition, so both are
a person's call. In a session where a human can answer the guard asks ("Yes = you accept it"); in the On-call
(`DF_ROLE=on-call`, set by feedback-desk.sh in the hook's own environment, which an agent's command cannot
reach) the wrapper's `accept` and `release` pass (the wrapper checks the sender); a direct `release.sh` (other than
the read-only `--list-unaccepted`), `--owner-accepts`, `--manual` and a hand-set label or comment are denied; the
On-call may run nothing but one plain `scripts/feedback-desk.sh accept|release|triage …` command (triage: the owner's
answer to the daily queue review, typed in the On-call session), the project's own script
by its path from the project root. DF_ROLE, DF_UNATTENDED, DESK_* and RELEASE_GH are fenced like GUARD: set,
exported or passed through `env` they are a fence change (a child claude would inherit the On-call's allowances); any other launched agent (subagent, pipeline, scheduled
run, `claude -p`) is denied: "leave it to the owner or the On-call".

Bypass is for a human only: restart the session with GUARD=off (the same idea as QUOTA_GUARD);
every call let through that way, every ask and every deny is logged to .claude/state/audit.jsonl.
