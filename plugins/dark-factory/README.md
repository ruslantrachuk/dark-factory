# dark-factory plugin

The part of the [dark factory](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/README.md) that is always on, packaged as a Claude Code plugin. Its hooks,
not written instructions, keep the agent away from the decisions that belong to a human:

- **Guard** (`scripts/guard.py`, PreToolUse on `Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit` and the scheduling tools).
  Denies force pushes and `+refspec`, a push to the main branch, `--no-verify` and other ways around the git hooks,
  release-tag pushes, GitHub API writes of refs, releases and branch protection, deleting or hard-resetting the main
  branch, any write into the installed plugin (`~/.claude/plugins/**`, `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, the plugin's state in
  `~/.cache/dark-factory`: the plugin changes through this repository and an update), and booking a
  `/dark-factory:level` prompt you did not type. At `standard` and `team` it also denies `gh pr merge` outside
  `scripts/merge-feature.sh` and approvals by the agent. Every denial says what to do instead.
  A change to the fences themselves is **asked**, not denied: at every level, deleting, moving or rewriting
  `.claude/fences.env`, lowering `FENCE_LEVEL` (or `QUOTA_FAIL_CLOSED` from 1 to 0), settings that switch off the
  hooks or the plugin (`disableAllHooks`, `GUARD`/`QUOTA_GUARD`, `enabledPlugins`, `claude plugin disable|uninstall`),
  shell writes to `.claude/settings*.json` and `.githooks/`; at `standard` and `team`, any edit of the fence files
  (`.claude/settings*.json`, `.claude/fences.env`, `.githooks/`, `scripts/merge-feature.sh`). Claude Code then shows
  the call in its permission dialog and runs it only on your yes. Where nobody can answer — a subagent, a session
  with `DF_UNATTENDED=1` (set by the On-call launcher), `claude -p` — it is denied with "leave it to the human:
  write the patch and a note, keep going".
  A **release is a person's decision** too: a run of `scripts/release.sh` that tags, and marking a feature accepted by
  hand (`gh pr edit --add-label accepted`, a comment "accepted by …", the API equivalents), is asked ("a release ships
  all of main since the last tag to production; Yes = you accept it"). In the On-call (`DF_ROLE=on-call`) a plain
  release and `--include-unaccepted "<name>"` pass, `--owner-accepts`, `--manual` and hand-set marks are denied, and its
  Bash is limited to one plain `scripts/feedback-desk.sh accept|release` command; any other launched agent is denied:
  "leave the release to the owner or the On-call". Every ask and deny is logged to `.claude/state/audit.jsonl`. The guard is
  a seatbelt, not a sandbox: see [What the guard is and is not](#what-the-guard-is-and-is-not).
- **Quota guard** (`scripts/quota.py`). Watches the subscription's 5-hour and 7-day windows: at 80% no new
  subagents or workflows, at 85% wrap up, at 90% only saving work, and the message names when work resumes so an
  autonomous session schedules its own continuation. Details: [docs/quota-guard.md](docs/quota-guard.md).
- **Git-hook repair** (`hooks/ensure-git-hooks.sh`, SessionStart). Points `core.hooksPath` back at `.githooks`
  when a worktree tool moved it; does nothing in a project without `.githooks/`.
- **`/dark-factory:init`**. Scaffolds the solo kit into the current project (below).
- **`/dark-factory:add <module>`**. Installs the full harness (`base`, level 1) or a module (`on-call`, `monitor`,
  `release`, `observability`, `code-audit`, `feature-pipeline`) from this plugin's [templates/](templates/README.md):
  the steps only you can do first, then the files, the filling in, the tests, the server units and a status check.
- **`/dark-factory:upgrade [v<N>]`**. Moves the project to a newer release on a work branch: `copier update` of the
  template files, the conflict markers resolved, the project steps of each release's "How to upgrade" notes applied,
  the server steps listed for you in the PR.
- **`/dark-factory:provision-server`**, **`/dark-factory:factory-status`** (`scripts/fleet.py`). Keep every project's
  sessions running on a Linux server across reboots, and show the state of all of them.
- **`/dark-factory:level`** (`scripts/level.py`). Shows the project's level on the ladder
  ([docs/levels.md](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/docs/levels.md)), the signals for the next one and what would change, and writes
  `FENCE_LEVEL` on your yes (below). A SessionStart hook prints one line when it sees a next-level signal.
- **`/dark-factory:statusline`** (`scripts/statusline.py`). Installs a statusLine wrapper that feeds the quota
  guard exact numbers and keeps your existing statusline; dry run first, `--uninstall` restores it.
- **`/dark-factory:feature`**. Runs the feature pipeline (`workflows/`) with the project's
  `.claude/factory/feature-pipeline.json`, so the settings are not passed by hand. The pipeline is token-expensive and is for
  unattended runs; in an interactive session work directly with the skills and roles below. `buildMode`
  (`--mode session|pipeline`) picks how a run is done: `session` (default) — one builder does the whole task by the stage
  skills, then one reviewer; `pipeline` — every stage by its own agents, parallel build waves, for a wide phase of
  independent slices. The run's path (lite or full) is the size the owner approved; an agent sizes it only when none
  is given.
- **Stage skills**: `plan` (a phase into end-to-end slices with files, tests and dependencies), `build-tdd` (one slice,
  test first), `integrate` (its commit, bd close, the full gate), `wrap` (bd note, project documents, the PR
  description). The same rules in a person's session and in the pipeline; each names the next.
- **Roles** (`agents/`): `dark-factory:tech-lead` (sizes work, slices it end to end, assesses risk, critiques a plan),
  `dark-factory:builder` (builds and integrates planned slices with the stage skills; the pipeline's writer),
  `dark-factory:product-owner` (necessity, user flow, acceptance scenarios, business value) and `dark-factory:reviewer`
  (read-only review through one lens). Call them by hand ("size this task as the tech lead") or let the workflows and the
  `feature-sanity-check` skill call them. A project replaces one by putting `.claude/agents/<name>.md` in the project.
  The `wsjf` skill holds the priority formula and scales they share.

The hooks read the project from `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. A project **opts in** with `.claude/fences.env`; in a
project without it the guards stay silent (one hint line at session start), so installing the plugin for your
user does not fence unrelated repositories.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add ruslantrachuk/dark-factory
/plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory
```

From a shell: `claude plugin marketplace add ruslantrachuk/dark-factory && claude plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory`
(`--scope project` records it in the project's `.claude/settings.json` instead of your user settings).
Requirements: Claude Code, `python3` 3.11+, `git`; `gh` and `jq` for `merge-feature.sh`.

## `/dark-factory:init` — the solo kit

Run it in a project. It shows a dry run, asks for your "yes", never overwrites a file, and adds:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | a short operating contract: feature branches, merge only through `merge-feature.sh`, the PR description as the record of work (`## Done` / `## Decisions` / `## Open questions`). Appended once to an existing file |
| `scripts/merge-feature.sh` | the merge transaction: push, PR, check the PR description, wait for CI, merge with the description as the merge commit message, clean up; re-runnable after any failure. Main branch and merge strategy filled in |
| `.claude/fences.env` | `FENCE_LEVEL=solo`; the file also opts the project in |
| `.githooks/pre-push` | runs your test command once per push (`TEST_CMD`), otherwise a no-op with a hint |
| `.claude/settings.json` | `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`, so collaborators who open the project are offered the plugin. Only missing keys are added |

It also sets `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` unless another hooks path is set. Nothing is committed or
pushed. The kit does not need beads, OpenSpec or a board; the full harness is the `base` template
([templates/](templates/README.md)), installed with `/dark-factory:add base`; it enables this plugin too.

## `/dark-factory:level` — the ladder

`/dark-factory:level` (`scripts/level.py`) reads the project's level from evidence in the project (it is never
stored), reports gaps at the current level and the signals for the next one, and changes `FENCE_LEVEL` (and
`QUOTA_FAIL_CLOSED`) up or down on your "yes". It writes only after you typed `/dark-factory:level <target>`
yourself: a UserPromptSubmit hook records a one-shot grant for that target, valid for 10 minutes; a bare
`/dark-factory:level` only reports. Lowering takes effect only once the lowered `fences.env` is merged into main, because
`origin/main` sets the floor. Structural steps (`/dark-factory:add`, `/dark-factory:provision-server`) it names and never runs.
The SessionStart hint is one line, at most once a day unless the signals change; `DARK_FACTORY_LEVEL_HINT=off`
silences it.

The ladder, the evidence for each level, the signals and the full fence-level table are in
[docs/levels.md](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/docs/levels.md).

## What the guard is and is not

The guard is a static reader of tool calls. It stops an agent's mistakes and the common shortcuts; it is not a
sandbox against a determined or hostile agent. It cannot see through a script written to a file and then run, an
alias defined elsewhere, a subprocess, or an arbitrary interpreter. The real gates are GitHub branch protection or
rulesets on main, required reviews and the Claude Code sandbox; turn on branch protection at every level.
At `solo` and `standard` the agent merges itself once CI is green and its own review is done; at `team` the PR also
needs a GitHub approval. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and the [threat model](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md).
Bypass is for a human only: restart the session with `GUARD=off claude` (quota: `QUOTA_GUARD=off claude`).

## Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall dark-factory@dark-factory
/plugin marketplace remove dark-factory
```

The files `init` wrote stay in the project; delete them yourself if you want them gone (`.claude/fences.env`
first — without it nothing is fenced even while the plugin is installed; the guard asks you before the agent
deletes it).

When you develop the plugin itself with `claude --plugin-dir <checkout>/plugins/dark-factory` inside an opted-in
checkout, `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is inside the project and is not fenced; the installed copies under
`~/.claude/plugins` still are.

## Development

The plugin's single source is this directory: commands (`skills/`), scripts, `templates/` (the `base` template, the
modules and the small `solo` kit `init` uses) and `workflows/`. `init` takes `merge-feature.sh` from
`templates/base/scripts/`, so there is one copy. Nothing in here may depend on a file outside this directory. The
plugin's tests live in the repository's `tests/` (run from the repository root), so they do not ship with it.

```bash
python3 tests/test_guard.py
python3 tests/test_quota.py
python3 tests/test_init_kit.py
python3 tests/test_level.py
python3 tests/test_add_module.py
python3 tests/test_fleet.py
claude plugin validate plugins/dark-factory && claude plugin validate .
```
