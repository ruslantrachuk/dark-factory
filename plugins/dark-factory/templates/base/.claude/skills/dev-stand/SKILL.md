description: Start, check, update and shut down the stands of <project> - the dev stand that runs main, where a human looks at features and accepts them, the preview of a local branch before its push, and an agent's temporary stand for screenshots. Use for "put it on the dev stand", "show me", "start the app", "can I take a look", "show me this branch", "start the preview", "update the stand", "shut the stand down", before asking anyone to accept a feature, and before taking screenshots of a branch.

# Skill `dev-stand` — the dev stand in one procedure

The dev stand runs the **main branch**. A merge into main puts a feature there; a human looks at it and accepts it
there (the owner says "release", or the On-call asks "ship?" and marks the PR `accepted`, see
[docs/layers/acceptance.md](https://github.com/ruslantrachuk/dark-factory/blob/main/docs/layers/acceptance.md)). Production is a separate step: a tag and the `release` branch.

Beside it the project has a **preview**, the stand of a local branch, to see the result before the push. Agents may
also raise **temporary stands** of their own branch, for screenshots. Both go only through the plugin's `stand.py`
and the project's `scripts/stand.sh` (section "Preview and temporary stands"), never by hand.

> A skeleton from the dark-factory canon: the rules and their order are generic (drawn from the
> dev-stand skills of several projects). The project fills in the `<…>` sections
> **from a live run**, not from memory. Once a run works, write it down here as commands, not prose.

## Dev stand rules (generic, do not change)

1. **Detached, so it outlives the session:** `setsid nohup … >/tmp/<project>_<component>.log 2>&1 </dev/null & disown`. Not as a Bash-tool background job: that would die with the session. `setsid` keeps a `pkill` of the old process from killing your shell.
2. **Do not kill someone else's process.** Before starting, check what is already running and whose it is: `ss -ltn` and `pgrep -af "<stack processes>"`. Kill only your own processes, with an exact pattern (put the port in the `pkill -f` pattern).
3. **Bind the database, Redis and service ports to `127.0.0.1` only.** Outside access goes only through an authenticated tunnel (Tailscale Serve, cloudflared). An open `0.0.0.0:5432` with a default password is how a database gets taken over by a ransomware bot.
4. **Do not read secrets:** load the environment with `set -a; . .env; set +a` inside the same command; log external API calls without tokens.
5. **The stand serves the main checkout** (dev mode: `--reload`, vite), not a built image, and follows main after each merge; otherwise "the changes aren't visible". On a provisioned server the server updates it, not a session: `scripts/stand-update.sh` (below) is run by `df-<slug>-stand` on every new commit of main — a session works in its own worktree and may not move the main checkout. If the stand is ever started from another worktree, set the code path explicitly (`PYTHONPATH=<wt>/src` or equivalent).
6. **An explicit database.** Pass the stand's connection string explicitly in the start command; tests and the stand never point at production.
7. **Background jobs** (scheduler, queues, mailings) that have been idle can send everything that piled up to real people at once. Before starting them, check what is overdue (`<project query>`) and decide with the owner.
8. **Restart a stand that a person or a live bot is using only on the owner's explicit "yes".**
9. **Smoke-test before saying "take a look":** backend health, the same answer through the frontend/proxy, one real route.
10. **Clean up after a temporary run:** `stand.py stop temp` for your temporary stand; seeded data and demo edits by hand. Leave things as you found them.

## Topology (fill in from a live run)

| Component | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|
| stand DB | `<DSN, port>` | `<what data; how it differs from the test DB>` |
| backend | `<command, 127.0.0.1:port>` | `<--reload>` |
| frontend | `<command, 127.0.0.1:port>` | `<proxy to the backend>` |
| outside access | `<tunnel URL>` | `<Tailscale Serve / cloudflared; how to check the route>` |
| background jobs | `<worker, beat, poller>` | `<what they send outside>` |

## Start

```bash
# 0. what is already running
ss -ltn | grep -E '<ports>' ; pgrep -af '<processes>'
# 1. dependencies (DB etc.) are alive
<command>
# 2. backend detached
<setsid nohup env … <command> >/tmp/<project>_api.log 2>&1 </dev/null & disown>
# 3. frontend detached
<…>
# 4. background jobs — only after rule 7
<…>
```

## Smoke

```bash
<curl backend health>
<curl health through the frontend/proxy>
<curl a real route: 200, or 401 without login = alive>
```

## Update after a merge

The server does it (`/dark-factory:provision-server` installs `df-<slug>-stand` once this script exists): every
minute it checks origin's main; on a new commit it moves the main checkout there — fast-forward when the checkout is
on `main`, detached otherwise; never when it has uncommitted changes or sits on another branch — and runs
`scripts/stand-update.sh` from it, with `STAND_SHA` set. Write the script from the Start and Smoke steps above,
once they work by hand: no `git` in it (the checkout is already moved), no background jobs unless rule 7 allows them
unattended, exit non-zero when the smoke fails.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/stand-update.sh — the dev stand on the commit the main checkout is on now (run by df-<slug>-stand)
set -euo pipefail
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
<dependencies up; migrations>
<build>
pkill -f '<exact pattern of the backend with its port>' || true
<setsid nohup env … <backend command> >/tmp/<project>_api.log 2>&1 </dev/null & disown>
<wait until it listens>
<smoke from the section above; exit 1 when it fails>
```

From a session, "update the stand" means: `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/fleet.py" status --project <slug>`
shows `dev stand — updated to <the merge commit>`, then the smoke. A failed update is in
`journalctl --user -u df-<slug>-stand`; the fix goes to main as a new commit, which the stand tries next. Without a
provisioned server (a Mac), update by hand: `git -C <main checkout> pull --ff-only && scripts/stand-update.sh`.

## Preview and temporary stands

The plugin's tool does the mechanics, the same in every project: it claims the port, starts the stand detached,
records its process, stops only that process, keeps the log and waits until the stand listens. The project gives it
`scripts/stand.sh`, holding only its stack.

```bash
S="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/stand.py"
python3 "$S" start preview --from <worktree> [--take]   # on a human's request: the branch on the preview's link
python3 "$S" stop|restart|logs preview
python3 "$S" start temp                                 # an agent's own frontend stand of the current worktree → URL
python3 "$S" stop temp
python3 "$S" ls                                         # every stand the tool runs: port, branch, link, log
```

- **The preview** is one per project, with its port and link in `stands.json` (below). It is started on a human's
  request in an interactive session. It runs on its **own database**, recreated and migrated from zero on every
  switch, since a branch may carry migrations; the tool refuses to start it on the main stand's database. A preview
  that serves another branch is switched only with `--take`, because someone may be looking at it.
- **A temporary stand** is an agent's own call, when it needs to see its branch, e.g. for screenshots before the
  report. It serves only the frontend, on a free port of the server's range (8210–8219), with the API proxied to the
  main stand. It writes nothing there, because that database is where features are accepted. There may be many at
  once. The status does not show them, and a forgotten one goes when its worktree does.
- **Exit codes:** 3 — no free port; 4 — refused (another branch on the preview, the main stand's database, a
  main-stand command); 1 — the project's script failed, its output follows.
- **Permission.** The project allows only the temporary-stand commands, so an agent asks nobody. Use an `autoMode`
  allow line: "`stand.py start temp`, `stop temp` and `ls` from the dark-factory plugin are routine". The preview and
  the main stand stay behind the permission prompt.

`scripts/stand.sh` — fill it in from a live run; the tool passes `STAND_KIND` (temp|preview|main), `STAND_CHECKOUT`,
`STAND_PORT`, `STAND_DIR` (its build directory) and `STAND_URL` (the stand's link, for CSRF and links in mail):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/stand.sh <step> — this project's stack for the plugin's stand.py (dev-stand skill)
set -euo pipefail
cd "$STAND_CHECKOUT"
case "$1" in
  build)    # the frontend into STAND_DIR (temp, preview)
    <dependencies: link the main checkout's node_modules when the lockfile is the same, else install>
    <frontend build --outDir "$STAND_DIR">
    ;;
  run)      # in the foreground, on 127.0.0.1:$STAND_PORT; the tool detaches it
    if [[ $STAND_KIND == temp ]]; then exec <serve STAND_DIR, API proxied to the main stand>; fi
    exec <backend of this checkout serving STAND_DIR, on the preview's database, public URL $STAND_URL>
    ;;
  prepare)  # the preview: its own database, dropped, created and migrated from zero; test users
    <…>
    ;;
  smoke)    # the preview: health, the SPA, one real route
    <…>
    ;;
  db)       # the database name, no credentials, for STAND_KIND (preview or main)
    <…>
    ;;
esac
```

The main stand stays the server's (section "Update after a merge"); `stand.py` refuses to start or stop it.

## Stands on the owner's status

`.claude/factory/stands.json` in the main checkout on the server lists the project's stands for the owner's status page
— the main one and the preview. It describes this server
(ports, tunnels, addresses), so it is not in git: write it when a stand starts to be kept running, edit it when one
goes away; the next feed picks it up. For each stand the status feed shows whether it answers, its link and where its
checkout is against main. No file, no stands shown.

```json
[{"name": "main", "port": <port>, "health": "<health route>", "checkout": ".", "tunnel": "<cloudflared container>"},
 {"name": "preview", "port": <port>, "health": "<health route>", "url": "https://<fixed address>"}]
```

`checkout` is relative to the project and stays inside it; the preview's is the worktree `stand.py` serves it from,
shown when that worktree is inside the project (`.claude/worktrees/`). `url` (https) or `tunnel` (the container of a
cloudflared quick tunnel, whose address is read from its log) gives the link.

## Hand it to the human

Link `<URL>` → `<how to log in: stand account>` → the right screen. Say exactly what to look at, as one list taken from the task's acceptance criteria.

## Stop and clean up

```bash
pkill -f '<exact pattern of your backend with its port>'
pkill -f '<exact pattern of your frontend with its port>'
<shut down your tunnel, delete seeded data, revert demo edits>
```
Check that things are back to normal: `<what should respond after cleanup>`.

## If something is wrong

- the backend is silent → `tail -20 /tmp/<project>_api.log` (migrations, secret, port taken)
- no data → the stand points at the wrong database (rule 6)
- changes aren't visible → not in dev mode, or code from another checkout (rule 5); on a server: `fleet.py status`
  says why `df-<slug>-stand` did not update (failed, uncommitted changes, another branch)
- the external link does not open → the tunnel route points at the wrong port
- `<project-specific cases>`
