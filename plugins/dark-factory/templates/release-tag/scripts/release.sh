# Release to prod only from a tag (factory module release-tag). The hosting
# builds the `release` branch; only a verified release moves it, a merge into
# main does not go to prod.
#
#   scripts/release.sh               put the next tag vYYYY.MM.DD.N on
#                                    origin/main and push it, but only when every
#                                    merge since the last v* tag is accepted (see
#                                    below). Then the
#                                    release.yml workflow runs light + heavy
#                                    tests and does --publish. Run by a release
#                                    manager (the tag ruleset lets only them push
#                                    v* tags), or by the agent at their explicit word.
#   scripts/release.sh --owner-accepts
#                                    the owner, in the interactive session, accepts
#                                    every unaccepted feature listed: the tag is put on,
#                                    then each PR gets the label `accepted` and the comment
#                                    "accepted by the owner, permission dialog".
#   scripts/release.sh --include-unaccepted "<who allowed>"
#                                    ship without the mark: the name goes into the
#                                    annotated tag and the release notes, each such PR
#                                    gets a comment once the tag is pushed.
#   scripts/release.sh --list-unaccepted
#                                    only print the merges since the last tag that lack
#                                    the mark, one per line: <PR number or ->TAB<title>TAB
#                                    <requester>; changes nothing (the On-call's wrapper
#                                    uses it to check who may allow them).
#   scripts/release.sh --publish T   move `release` to tag T + a commit with
#                                    the VERSION file and create a GitHub
#                                    Release with auto-generated notes. Called by
#                                    release.yml; repeating the same tag is a
#                                    no-op (adds a missing GitHub Release).
#   scripts/release.sh --manual --reason "<why>" --by "<human name>"
#                                    EMERGENCY (Actions are down): tag + --publish
#                                    right away, no tests. VERSION gets a manual mark;
#                                    the reason and the name of the person who decided
#                                    go into the annotated tag and the release notes.
#                                    Refused at FENCE_LEVEL=team (.claude/fences.env):
#                                    there a release goes through the tag ruleset + CI only.
#
# Acceptance: a release takes all of main. Every first-parent commit since the last v* tag
# (`git log <tag>..origin/main --first-parent`; the first release: since the root) is
# listed, a merge, a squash and a rebase alike, and each PR must carry the label `accepted`
# (set after the owner or the requester said yes on the dev stand). The PR number comes from
# the subject, "(#N)" or "Merge pull request #N"; a PR is counted once. A commit without one
# is not a PR (a direct push, a rebase merge) and needs an override. Without the
# mark the script refuses and prints each unaccepted feature with its title and
# requester (the `## Requested by` section of the PR description), so the caller can
# ask again. --manual and --publish do not check.
#
# Tags are fetched with --force: actions/checkout on a tag creates a local
# lightweight tag, and without --force git refuses to replace it with the
# annotated one.
#
# RELEASE_DATE (YYYY.MM.DD) — date override for tests; defaults to today in RELEASE_TZ.
# RELEASE_GH — the gh command: for the test suite (a stub) and the owner's own shell, never for an agent: the
# dark-factory guard treats setting it as a fence change, and feedback-desk.sh (the On-call's way to release)
# unsets it. Actions need GH_TOKEN; the acceptance check needs gh logged in.
# RELEASE_MAIN_BRANCH, RELEASE_TZ — override the values below (for tests).
