# The session gets only the tools its job needs (DESK_TOOLS, DESK_PERMISSION_MODE, desk_allow_rules,
# desk_deny_rules): Bash only for the two subcommands above (every other call is denied without a prompt), no file
# edits, no subagents, Read only in its own directory and the user-facing docs — the client group can talk to it.
